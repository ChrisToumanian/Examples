# Snow is simply the `#` symbol here. Half of the snow moves at 1 char
# per frame, while the other half moves at 0.5 chars per frame. The
# program ends when all the snow reaches the bottom of the screen.
# The viewing area is 80x25. It puts 100 snow flakes to output, half
# fast, and half slow. Every frame it dispenses 4 flakes, 2 fast and
# 2 slow ones, at random locations at the top of the viewing area.
